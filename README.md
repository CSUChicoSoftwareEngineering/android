Purpose:

To create a simple group management website to allow easier scheduling and file sharing between group members. Users will be able to create and/or join groups which will be protected by passwords, see a list of all members in their groups, add their personal available meeting times and get one schedule view which highlights the optimal meeting times for all members. File sharing will allow users to upload files that they wish to share with the group. Further improvements can include an events schedule, and improved UI.
    
Repo Organization:

The latest files can be found in the "final-1.0" folder in the repo. Within that folder, the PHP/HTML files are within one folder, the CSS styling in another, and in the MySQL folder you will find the MySQL database configuration information. The "presentations" folder in the repo contains our group presentation files including the powerpoint, executive summary, and readme. The "test_files" folder contains our work files through various stages of improvements and changes before they are pushed to the final version. "Todo.md" lists the latest known bugs, top priorities, and contact information for any questions or permissions.
