Purpose:
    To create a simple group management website to allow easier scheduling and file sharing. Users will be able to create and/or join groups which will be protected by passwords, see a list of all members in their groups, add their personal available meeting times and get one schedule view which highlights the optimal meeting times for all members. File sharing will allow users to upload files that they wish to share with the group.
