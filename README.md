Get To Know The Team:

Jared DuBose (Red)
    Studying to be a AI technician for Video Games and to Design for Games. It is a hobby and hopefully will be my career. 
    My skills are Game State and I have a knowledge in Game Engines. I can adapt and learn quickly, having created networked     games, AI, controllers, and have exported to Mobile devices as well as to PCs but never to a market.
