Project: GroupR - Group Management Website

Known Bugs:
  1. Change password script may not connect to database correctly at times
  2. Some error messages, such as failed login may appear at wrong locations
  3. File management not fully functioning; file seems to upload to set folder, but does not register in database

Top Priority:
  1. Continue work on file management and get it fully functioning
  2. Verify all functionality of website via test users; registering, joining/creating group, changing password, forgot password, etc.
  
Other:
  1. UI was very simple, CSS styling was group's weakpoint. Would like to implement better, more functional UI
